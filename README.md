### This update is long overdue. Hello! Nice seeing you here! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am Fridah Akinyi Odhiambo. Professionally, I moved from being an Electrical and Communications Engineering graduate to an Android Developer/Trainer and finally to the AWS Champion - Authorised Instructor that I am now. I am just laying it all out here to assure you beyond reasonable doubt that there is a high probability that the next time you are back here, I could be something else that is even more amazing than the last.

âœ¨ :balloon: âœ¨
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting **Google Cloud Certifications**.

- ðŸŒ± I am learning how to be an **Google Cloud Authorized Trainer and Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect**.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Professional, AWS Certified DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional** and **Android Development** discussions.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **AWS** and **Android Development**, though I am yet to catch up on Android Dev for the past year.

### Social Network Presence
