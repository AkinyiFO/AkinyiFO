### This update is long overdue. Hello! Nice seeing you here! 👋 
I am Fridah Akinyi Odhiambo. Professionally, I moved from being an Electrical and Communications Engineering graduate to an Android Developer/Trainer and finally to the AWS Authorised Instructor that I am now. I am just laying it all out here to assure you beyond reasonable doubt that there is a high probability that the next time you are back here, I could be something else that is even more amazing than the last.

✨ :balloon: ✨
- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting more **AWS Certifications**.

- 🌱 I am learning how to be an **AWS Solutions Architect - Professional**.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **AWS Solutions Architect - Associate, AWS Developer - Associate*, AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate** and **Android Development** discussions.

- 💬 Ask me about **AWS** and **Android Development**, though I am yet to catch up on Android Dev for the past year.
